# PortalPlugin

This is based on [dotblank's PortalPlugin](https://github.com/dotblank/PortalMod) that was used on discovr.us as well as PrecipiceGames. I've since updated it so that it no longer relies on the long deprecated data values. At this time, the only version that has been updated is the original wool and jukebox version (which was used exclusively on discovr's creative server). I will be porting my patches to the newer (better) version later. This has always been an interesting concept to me. It essentially uses blocks as multipliers against your current coordinates to teleport you a certain distance in any direction. Yep, you guessed it.. it's a PITA. It does challenge you mathematically though, which is always fun. I am not going to attempt to create a tutorial for usage.. *shivers*.
